description: Generate the daily work journal — collect today's AI usage across Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and Codex CLI plus git activity into a digest, then write the narrative, technical, and next-day-plan summaries. Use when the user asks for their work journal, daily summary, "what did I do today", or to plan tomorrow.

# Daily work journal

Resolve the plugin root before shelling out: use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` if it is set; otherwise
resolve `../..` relative to this SKILL.md to an ABSOLUTE path (bash cwd is not the skill dir).
Call that root `$ROOT` below.

## Collect the digest

Run the collector to build today's digest from local, read-only sources:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_collect.py"
```

Useful flags: `--date YYYY-MM-DD` for a specific day (default: today), `--repo PATH` to add a
git repo to scan (repeatable), `--print` to echo the digest to stdout as well as writing it.
The collector is deterministic and read-only over `~/.claude`, `~/.copilot`, and `~/.codex` —
it never calls a model and never touches the network. It writes only under the gitignored
`journal/<date>/` directory (`digest.json`), nowhere else. The digest now also deepens Codex
with the day's rollout files and, when tokens are found, carries a clearly-labeled
API-equivalent relative-burn proxy under `sources.codex_cli.extra.codex_proxy` — never a bill
(`billed_usd` stays null), never counted into `usd_priced`.

## Persist today's telemetry (right after collecting)

Capture the day's analytics into the durable store — the transcript dirs the digest
reads from ROTATE, and this snapshot is what survives:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/telemetry_snapshot.py"
```

It imports the analytics modules and calls their builders directly — read-only over
`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, and `~/.copilot`, spawning no CLI and writing only under the
gitignored `telemetry/` (dated envelopes, one per source per day; same-day re-runs
overwrite, except that a failed re-run never replaces a good envelope). The envelope's
filename date is the LOCAL day — the same day this journal is keyed on, so an evening run
files under today, not tomorrow (`captured_at` inside each envelope stays UTC).
Best-effort: if it fails, note the failure and continue with the journal —
the snapshot never blocks the summaries.

## Write the summaries (in this session — default)

Get the exact prompts for today's digest:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_summarize.py" --date <date> --dry-run
```

This prints the three prompts (narrative, technical, next-day-plan) without dispatching any
model — the current session is already paid for, so write the documents yourself instead of
spawning a nested call. Read `journal/<date>/digest.json` for the facts, follow each printed
prompt's required headings exactly, and use only digest facts — no invented details, no
transcript text. Save your three drafts as `journal/<date>/narrative.md`,
`journal/<date>/technical.md`, and `journal/<date>/next-day.md`. When done, summarize the three
documents for the user and link their paths — do not paste full drafts back into chat. When
`signals.harness` is present, follow the next-day prompt's `## Harness plan` section —
per-task harness + model tier + ready-to-paste command + one-line WHY, advisory only.

## Or run it headless

For an unattended run (e.g. from the nightly schedule) let the script dispatch a model itself:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_summarize.py" --date <date>
```

This tries a routed cheap/mid model tier first, with at most one escalation to the next tier,
and exits with code 3 if any of the three documents still failed after that escalation. Use
`--start-tier` to pick the starting tier and `--model` to pin one model id explicitly (this
skips escalation).

## Inbox & schedule

Drop meeting notes or email to-dos into `journal/inbox.md` as plain lines; the next collection
folds them into the digest so they resurface as next-day to-dos. To run the collector and
summarizer automatically every night, install the schedule:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_schedule.py" install
```

This writes a launchd plist (default 22:00) and prints the `launchctl bootstrap` command needed
to activate it — the installer never runs `launchctl` itself, so loading the schedule is the
user's own later, manual step. Use `uninstall` to remove the plist, `status` to check whether
it is loaded, and `run` (with `--collect-only` or `--dry-run`) for a manual one-shot in between
scheduled runs.

## Next-day runbook

Once a digest exists, build tomorrow's runbook — a dated, checkable plan of next-day tasks:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_plan.py" build
```

It writes `journal/plan/<date>.md` — one dated, checkable card per planned task (drawn from
open kit tasks, WIP repos, the inbox, and `journal/plan/seed.md`), each with a What/How, an
ideal-harness line, and ready-to-paste commands for Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and Codex CLI
with cost estimates from the pricing files (Codex figures are API-equivalent proxies, never a
bill). Unchecked cards from earlier days carry forward automatically.

Enrich the What/How steps in this session (the current session is already paid for — the
summaries precedent): run

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_plan.py" prompt
```

follow the printed prompt exactly (rewrite ONLY the What/How bodies, keep every other line
byte-identical — the H1, checkboxes, field lines, and Harness blocks), and save the revised
document back over the same `journal/plan/<date>.md` path.

On the day tasks are due, check and track them:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_plan.py" check
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_plan.py" done <id> --date <file-date>
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_plan.py" defer <id> --to <date> --date <file-date>
```

(or just edit the checkboxes in the markdown by hand — the file is yours). On quiet days,
hand-add lines to `journal/plan/seed.md` (same plain-line format as the inbox) and rebuild.

Advisory only: the runbook prepares and tracks — it never schedules or executes anything.
Every command above is text you choose to run, and there is no scheduler here by design (the
user tabled it).

## External tools (Teams / Outlook / Copilot Studio)

The journal has no Graph/OAuth/MCP connectors and never will by default — instead it generates
an offline **ask-the-tools** pack you run yourself, in your own Microsoft tools, two passes:

```bash
python3 "$ROOT/bin/journal_askpack.py" --date <date> --print
```

This writes `journal/<date>/ask-the-tools.md` with one ready-to-paste prompt per tool
(Copilot Studio, Teams, Outlook) and also prints them to stdout. Run each printed prompt
inside that tool's own AI, then paste the bullet results it gives you back into
`journal/inbox.md`. Re-run the collector and redo the summaries so the enriched inbox flows
into the digest. This is offline text generation only: the journal never adds network,
OAuth, Graph, or MCP calls to fetch this content — you carry it over by hand. Each prompt
asks for at most 15 subject-level bullets per tool (titles, people, decisions, action
items — no message bodies).

## Privacy

Writing the summaries sends the digest — project and repo names, commit subjects, kit task
titles, and any inbox text — to a model. The digest itself is metadata-only: it never carries
transcript or message text, only counts, ids, titles, and short strings like the above.
Everything the journal produces stays under the gitignored `journal/` directory; nothing here
is committed to git. Pasted ask-the-tools bullets become inbox text, so they also travel to
the model when you write the summaries.
