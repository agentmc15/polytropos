description: Analyze historical Claude Code usage from local transcripts — spend by model, most expensive sessions, and sessions where a cheaper model would have sufficed. Use when the user asks what they've spent, which model they've been using, or where they could save.

# Historical cost report

Run the analyzer script that ships with this plugin. Use the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` env var
Claude Code sets for plugin-executed content; if it is unset, fall back to resolving
`../../bin/cost_report.py` relative to this SKILL.md to an absolute path:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/cost_report.py" --days 30
```

Flags:
- `--days N` — lookback window (default 30)
- `--mode api|subscription` — framing (default: `billing_mode` from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/data/pricing.json`)
- `--top N` — how many top sessions to list (default 10)

The script walks `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, extracts per-message model + usage (input/output/cache tokens), dedupes by message id, and prices everything from `data/pricing.json` (Sonnet 5 intro pricing applied by date).

## Presenting the results

The script emits markdown. Summarize it for the user rather than dumping raw output:

1. **Headline**: total API-equivalent cost over the window and which model dominated.
2. **By-model table**: as emitted.
3. **Downgrade candidates** (sessions on Fable/Opus with a small footprint — under ~50K tokens and few tool calls):
   - In `api` mode: present the dollar delta as savings ("these sessions would have cost $X.XX less on Sonnet 5").
   - In `subscription` mode: present it as burn share ("these sessions spent rate-limit budget on Fable for Sonnet-sized work") — dollars are API-equivalent, not spend.
4. One actionable recommendation, e.g. a default-model or effort-level change, based on what the data shows.

If the script errors on unexpected transcript formats, show the error and the file it choked on — don't silently skip everything.
