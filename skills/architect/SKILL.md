description: Plan a complex task once on Fable 5 and write the execution kit — PLAN.md, TASKS.md, GUARDRAILS.md, and model-pinned agents — that a cheaper model then executes at near-Fable quality. Use when the user says "plan this with Fable", "architect this", "review this codebase", or escalates a complex task. Not for running a kit; that is /polytropos:execute.

# Fable-as-architect

The goal: **Fable 5 runs once, at the start; its judgment persists as scaffolding.** The output is not just a plan — it is an *execution kit* a lesser model can run at near-Fable quality, because every decision that needed Fable-level judgment is already made and written down.

## Step 0 — Get onto Fable 5

Check the current session model. Two entry modes:

- **Dispatch mode** (session is on Opus/Sonnet — the normal daily-driver case): spawn the architecture work as a subagent via the Agent tool with `model: fable`. Give it this entire skill's Steps 1–3 as instructions plus a complete brief of the task and all relevant conversation context (the subagent sees none of it otherwise). It writes the kit files directly; you relay its summary. The main session never leaves the daily driver.
- **Native mode** (user already ran `/model fable`, or wants to steer interactively): do Steps 1–3 in this session, then remind them to switch back (`/model opus`) once the kit is built.

If the task is ambiguous, ask the scoping questions BEFORE burning Fable time — Fable works best with the full spec up front in one shot.

## Step 1 — The plan

Write `.claude/kits/<slug>/PLAN.md` in the target project (`<slug>` = short kebab-case task name):

- **Goal** and what "done" looks like (checkable, not vibes)
- **Constraints** and out-of-scope (explicitly fence what executors must NOT do)
- **Architecture & key decisions, each with rationale** — the "why" is what lets a cheaper model make consistent micro-decisions later
- **Risks and their tripwires** — what an executor should watch for and what to do when hit
- **Autonomy posture (optional)** — a single `autonomy: advisory` or `autonomy: auto` line anywhere in PLAN.md (absent = advisory). Execute reads it as the kit's dial for live re-routing and auto-escalation; the user can override it per run at invocation. An optional PLAN.md line, not a task field — the task-field contract is unchanged.
- **Budget dial (optional)** — a single `budget: max-dispatches=N max-escalations=N max-consults=N` line anywhere in PLAN.md (any subset of the three keys; absent = unbounded, today's behavior). Execute's own loop and all three headless drivers (`bin/claude_execute.py`, `bin/copilot_execute.py`, `bin/codex_execute.py`) honor it: on reaching a declared cap they stop cleanly, leave the remaining tasks' status untouched, and append ONE `outcome: ... result=budget-stop` line (`run=` included) instead of dispatching — never folded into a fluent summary. Like `autonomy:`, this is a PLAN.md line family, never a task field — the task-field contract is unchanged.
- **Roles roster (optional)** — a single `roles: <token> <token> ...` line anywhere in PLAN.md, naming the optional pipeline roles this kit adds beyond the standing trio (implementer / verifier / reviewer). Tokens come from exactly seven: `scout`, `test-author`, `second-verifier`, `red-team`, `security-auditor`, `docs-editor`, `synthesizer`; anything else is out of grammar. Absent = the trio, today's behavior — every kit written before this dial existed stays valid, and nothing here changes the default or auto-declares a role. An optional `workflow:` line names the assurance level: `reviewed` (the trio, default), `extended` (trio + declared roles), or `direct` (implementer and deterministic checks only, no independent review; say it by name, never beside `roles:`). Declare a role for a stated purpose from the task's risk, never because the name exists; its contract is `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kit_contract.py roster --kit .claude/kits/<slug> --json`, and a headless driver refuses or discloses a role it cannot sequence, never skips it. Execute reads the line once at setup, dispatches each declared role at its own hook point, and records every declared-role dispatch as an `agent:` line in the kit's NOTES.md so the roster can be measured afterwards. Like `autonomy:` and `budget:`, this is a PLAN.md line family, never a task field — the task-field contract is unchanged.

**Before dispatching wide exploratory reads over an unfamiliar target repo**, check whether it already carries a `graphify-out/graph.json` (or offer the user `/polytropos:graphify` to build one — an optional, external, availability-gated tool, not assumed present). When a graph exists, `python3 bin/graph_ground.py ground --graph <path> --seed <file-or-symbol>` (freshness against the working tree, a bounded walk from the seeds, a search fallback when the graph is stale, unknown, or silent), `python3 bin/graph_brief.py brief --graph <path>`, and a few targeted `graphify explain <symbol>` calls ground the plan at near-zero context cost. Read the freshness verdict first: a `stale` or `unknown` graph is hints, not evidence. But the graph's limits bind — dynamic loaders (importlib, plugin registries) are invisible to its AST extraction, and the absence of an edge is never evidence of the absence of a dependency — so treat it as a first map that narrows where to look next, never as the sole evidence backing a contract or dependency claim in PLAN.md.

## Step 2 — The execution kit

This is the part that makes lesser models perform above their weight. Produce:

### `TASKS.md` (same kit directory)
Ordered task list. Every task must be executable by a model with **zero access to this conversation**:
- `id`, `title`, `status` (pending/in-progress/done/blocked), `model` (sonnet default; opus for the genuinely hard ones; haiku for trivial mechanical ones)
- **Self-contained brief**: files involved, relevant conventions, interfaces/contracts pinned down exactly, known gotchas, and the *why* behind the approach
- **Acceptance criteria**: concrete and checkable
- **Verify command**: a shell command (tests, build, lint, a curl) that proves the task done
- **Optional `evidence:`** — `red-green` (default), `regression`, or `precondition`. Default means the verify command must be able to fail before the work; if it already passes, execute blocks the task. Mark `regression`/`precondition` when passing beforehand is the point (refactors, drift guards) — not to silence a check that should have gone red.
- Tasks are grouped under `## Phase N — <name>` headings; the execute loop dispatches the reviewer agent at each phase end.
- Each task marks ordering explicitly: `depends: <ids>` or `independent: yes` — execute parallelizes only tasks marked independent. `depends:` is machine-read: ids of task blocks in this kit, comma-separated, or `(none)` — never prose, ranges, or another kit's ids. Ids are unique; no self-dependency; no cycle. Execution validates the whole graph first and refuses an invalid kit, naming each finding (`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/kit_contract.py graph --kit .claude/kits/<slug>`).
- Flag **warm-cluster candidates** as free text in the TASKS.md dispatch preamble (e.g. "T2 → T3 → T4 are strictly serial (same file)"): serial `depends:` chains that share a primary file and carry the same `model` pin. Execute may then serve the whole cluster with one continued (warm) implementer instead of N cold spawns; tasks marked `independent:` still fan out fresh. This is a hint, not a new task field — the task-field contract is unchanged.
- The task's `model` field is authoritative at dispatch time: execute passes it as the Agent tool's `model` parameter, which overrides the implementer agent's frontmatter default. When a kit runs with the autonomy dial on `auto`, execute may layer a logged, upgrade-only runtime override on top at dispatch (one tier step, never to frontier) — the field itself is never rewritten and stays the dispatch default.
- **Consult the routing history when choosing the initial `model` pins:** `python3 bin/routing_scorecard.py --history` is EVIDENCE, not an auto-pin-setter — the architect weighs it and decides. Read `references/routing-evidence.md` when choosing pins or declaring roles: how to read the `--history` and `--roles` cards, the escalation lineage and failure breakdown, and the recurring brief-defect kinds that are evidence about your own briefs.
- Execute maintains a `NOTES.md` beside PLAN.md/TASKS.md — cross-task learnings plus machine-read ledger lines (`outcome:`, `agent:`, `reviewer:`, `defect:`) that `bin/routing_scorecard.py` reads. The architect creates none of them, and the task-field contract (`id`/`title`/`status`/`model`/brief/acceptance/verify) is unchanged by them; their fields and rules are in `references/routing-evidence.md`.

Pin down contracts and interfaces precisely; leave implementation judgment open where any competent model would do fine. Over-prescription wastes the kit; under-specification wastes the executor.

### Project subagents (`.claude/agents/` in the target project)
Only create what the kit needs and doesn't already exist. Typical trio, each with project-specific conventions baked into its prompt:
- `<slug>-implementer.md` — `model: sonnet` — executes one task brief exactly; stops and reports rather than improvising when the brief is wrong
- `<slug>-verifier.md` — `model: haiku` (or sonnet if judgment needed), `tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob` — fresh-context adversarial check of acceptance criteria; never trusts the implementer's claims, reruns the verify command itself
- `<slug>-reviewer.md` — `model: opus`, `tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob` — reviews completed phases against PLAN.md for drift

**Pin the read-only roles' `tools:` frontmatter — mandatory for every kit you generate.** Verifier and reviewer get `tools: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob` (read/search plus Bash, no Write, no Edit); the implementer's tools stay unpinned, because writing is its job. Scope structurally rather than by instruction: a verifier with no editor cannot be talked into fixing the defect while it is in there. But write the honest limit into the agent file too, instead of trusting the pin — Bash alone can delete or rewrite any tracked file, and in this repo a verifier holding exactly this pin destroyed an authored docs section during mutation testing, never restored it, and reported its own damage as the implementer's defect. Removing Write/Edit removes the *casual* path, not the capability. So pair the pin with the practice that actually closes the gap, stated in both read-only agents' prompts: prefer non-mutating checks; when a check genuinely needs mutation, copy the target to a temp directory and mutate the copy, never a tracked file in place; if the tree is touched anyway, restore it byte-for-byte before reporting and say so; and close with `git status --porcelain`, reporting any unexpected change as the agent's own defect, never the implementer's.

**When PLAN.md declares a `roles:` line, instantiate each declared role from its template.** This skill ships one generic template per optional role at `skills/architect/references/roles/<role>.md` (resolve via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, falling back to "relative to this SKILL.md") — each a complete agent file with frontmatter, the role's mission, its hook point in the pipeline, and its recording contract. Copy the template to `.claude/agents/<slug>-<role>.md` in the target project and replace every `<slug>` placeholder with the kit slug and `<repo-root>` with the target repo's root. Templates are consumer-neutral: they name the kit's `GUARDRAILS.md` and the repo's own conventions, never this plugin's — put the target's fences there. Keep the template's `model:` default and its tools posture as written — the read-only roles carry the same `tools:` pin and damage-restore practice as the verifier and reviewer above; the write-capable roles (`test-author`, `docs-editor`, `synthesizer`) carry a scoped write mission instead of a pin — unless this kit has a specific reason to differ, in which case state the reason in PLAN.md. Do not widen a template's mission to cover another role's ground: the boundaries are the design (`red-team` attacks beyond the acceptance criteria rather than re-running the verifier's checks; `security-auditor` is fences, leaks, and injection surface only, not the reviewer's drift review; `second-verifier` must carry a stated different lens from the verifier's). And as with the trio, never reuse the name of an agent listed in an aesop manifest's `primitives.agents`.

### Harness guardrails
Write the kit's fences to `.claude/kits/<slug>/GUARDRAILS.md` — task-scoped conventions, forbidden shortcuts, "always run X before claiming done". Execute reads the file at setup, so they load only when this kit runs and never tax other sessions. Always create this file, one per kit, no exceptions: if the kit genuinely needs no fences beyond PLAN.md's out-of-scope section, write that sentence and point at PLAN.md rather than omitting the file — an absent file is indistinguishable from a forgotten one, and a layout check that requires it fails the whole suite (hence every task's verify command), not just the kit that skipped it. Give it real substance, not a stub. Add to the target project's global `CLAUDE.md` only an invariant that is genuinely permanent and project-wide — true for every future session, not just this kit — and sparingly: that file is loaded everywhere, forever. Prefer judgement over rules: state the principle and name the signal to read (e.g. "match the surrounding file's error-handling style") instead of an absolute — EXCEPT rules protecting real money, live CLIs, or user data, which stay absolute and explicit. If a procedure is complex enough, make it a project skill (`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) instead. These are the Fable-judgment rails the executors run on.

**Aesop-managed target?** If the target project has an `aesop.yaml` at its root, or an `<!-- aesop:begin` fence in its `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, those files are compiled output — hand-edits get flagged as drift by `aesop sync` and overwritten by `aesop compile`. Put the guardrails in `aesop.yaml` under `primitives.instructions.blocks` (scope: project) instead, then run `aesop compile` and confirm `aesop sync` reports no drift. Kit directories (`.claude/kits/…`) and kit-prefixed agent files are safe to write directly — aesop tracks only files it emits — but never reuse the name of an agent listed in the manifest's `primitives.agents`.

## References — read when

- `references/routing-evidence.md` — read when choosing `model` pins, declaring a `roles:` line, or reading a kit's ledger: the `--history` and `--roles` cards, the roster comparison ladder, the `outcome:` line's optional fields, and what `budget-stop` means.
- `references/roles/<role>.md` — the seven optional-role templates instantiated in Step 2.

## Step 3 — Handoff

End with exactly what happens next, e.g.:

> Kit ready at `.claude/kits/<slug>/`. Switch back to your daily driver (`/model opus`) and run `/polytropos:execute <slug>`. Blocked tasks escalate back to Fable one at a time — you won't pay Fable prices for execution.

The kit's model-pinned agents mean the model mix is enforced automatically during execution — nobody has to remember to downgrade.
