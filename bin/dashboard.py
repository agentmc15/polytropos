"""The observability dashboard: one offline HTML page over the stores the owning engines write.

WHAT THIS IS. A read-only consumer and presentation layer. It lists the per-user data home that
`bin/runtime_data.py` resolves, maps each namespace in it back to a checkout, and renders what
the owning engines already output -- the attempt ledger and its history projection, the routing
scorecard, telemetry envelopes, journal digests, evaluation runs, as their panels land -- into
ONE self-contained `index.html` plus a `build.json` receipt in this engine's own `dashboard`
store. The user opens the file in a browser; refreshing is a rebuild, so the page prints the
moment it was built.

WHAT IT REFUSES.

- To be a second analysis authority. It prices nothing, adds no figures together, ranks nothing
  and classifies no failure. Its own arithmetic is counting what it enumerated, the age between
  two dates, and picking the latest of a set. Owners' labels and notes render verbatim.
- To reach the network. The page carries a Content-Security-Policy that forbids every load, and
  nothing in it references a URL: no script, no external style, no font, no image source. The
  engine spawns nothing but the git verbs of D4 through proc_runner -- `git rev-parse
  --show-toplevel` and `git worktree list --porcelain`, both read-only, both bounded by
  GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, run only in a candidate checkout, both off under `--no-git`, and either
  failing is a note, never an error.
- To write anywhere but its own store. `index.html` and `build.json` land under
  `runtime_data.store_path("dashboard", <primary checkout>)` or `--out-dir`, through
  bin/safe_paths.py, 0700/0600. Nothing in any other store, namespace, harness home or checkout
  is written, moved or deleted -- residue included.
- To open residue beyond one listing, or to delete anything at all.

THE PRIMARY CHECKOUT, AND WHY NEVER PLUGIN_ROOT ON ITS OWN. The page belongs to the checkout
being observed: the git toplevel of the working directory, or the working directory itself when
git is off or cannot say. PLUGIN_ROOT is where this file lives -- under a skill, a plugin cache,
which is not a checkout and must never own a store -- so it is used only to load sibling
modules. It is never added as a candidate and never used as a git working directory in its own
right. A development clone that the working directory, a `--checkout` flag or `config.json`
names is a candidate like any other, even when this file happens to live in it.

THE RESIDUE HEURISTIC, AND ITS LIMIT. Test runs that leaked into the real data home left
namespaces named like a `tempfile` directory plus runtime_data's digest. A namespace counts as
residue when its name matches RESIDUE_NAMESPACE_RE AND one shallow listing of it holds nothing
but an `attempts` store. Residue is counted, sampled by name, excluded from every figure, and
never opened again. It is a heuristic and the page says so: a genuine checkout whose directory
is named like a temp dir, and whose only store is the attempt ledger, is miscounted as residue.

PRIVACY. Every string is HTML-escaped and every path is scrubbed to `~` in the render layer
(`scrub`, with the home directory resolved once in `main` and passed down). No transcript,
prompt, report, tail or inbox text reaches the page: no owner the dashboard calls returns any,
and the ledger's free-text fields are never rendered.
